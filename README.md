# CytoData25
At the CytoData Hackathon, participants will tackle real-world data analysis challenges in image-based profiling by applying analysis workflows to large-scale Cell Painting datasets generated at EU-OPENSCREEN [1]. Currently, EU-OPENSCREEN is developing a comprehensive Cell Painting dataset comprising 100,000 compounds, which will be made available for exploration during the event. We also aim to integrate this dataset with other complementary data resources [2, 3].

If you are a cell biologist, chemist, machine learning researcher, computational biologist, or data scientist who wants to dive deep into large-scale high-content image data you are very welcome to join us at the hackathon!

No previous experience with Cell Painting data required, we will get you up to speed. Basic data science proficiency is important.

We will work collaboratively by forming mixed teams, solve challenges and learn from each other in a dynamic, hands-on environment. All necessary IT infrastructure will be provided to support your work throughout the event. Finally, we aim to publish the results of the hackathon as BioHackrXiv Preprint [4]
